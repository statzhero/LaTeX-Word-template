# LaTeX template for Microsoft Word

LaTeX is a typesetting language used in academic environments. It has a characteristic look such as numbered headings. However, its learning curve is steep and working in LaTeX can be fiddly. One group of researchers wrote: _We conclude that even experienced LaTeX users may suffer a loss in productivity when LaTeX is used, relative to other document preparation systems._ [Knauff & Nejasmic 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069)

## Install
1. Download and install the Latin Modern Fonts at http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern/download, an improved version of the Computer Modern font.
2. Download the [template](https://github.com/statzhero/LaTeX-Word-template/blob/master/Normal.dotm?raw=true) in this repo. (The `dotx` file is also provided for legacy versions of Word 2008.) Either open it and start writing or apply the template to an already existing document. Both should work fine.
3. For permanent changes to the default template, see below.
